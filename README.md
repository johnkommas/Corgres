3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
4. Upload your Excel file and follow the steps to process and download

**Email Integration Setup:**
Set the following environment variables (e.g., in a .env file) if you plan to use email scanning:
- `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_PASS`
- Optional: `MAIL_FOLDER` (defaults to `INBOX`)

Then use:
- List folders: GET `/mail-folders/`
- Scan emails: GET `/scan-emails/?days=7&folders=INBOX`

**Web Interface:**
Access Corgres through any modern web browser - no client installation needed.

## Application Hub & Real-Time Unique Visitors

The landing ‚ÄúApplication Hub‚Äù (/) shows available apps (Excel Formatter, Retail Pricing) with live status and counts.

- Status: Each card shows ‚ÄúAvailable‚Äù or ‚ÄúIn Use‚Äù.
- Count: The number shown is unique visitors per app (not connections). A single person with multiple tabs or windows counts as 1 for that app.
- Identification: Visitors are identified by a persistent visitorId stored in localStorage.
- Per‚Äëapp tracking: Joining an app adds your visitorId to that app; leaving removes it.

### How it works under the hood
- The browser establishes a WebSocket to `/ws/app-status` and sends:
  - `identify` once (includes visitorId, browser/platform, tab id)
  - `heartbeat` every 15 seconds
  - `join` on app entry and `leave` on exit
- The server considers a connection stale if it hasn‚Äôt received a heartbeat for 30 seconds. On last-connection cleanup, the visitor is removed from the app‚Äôs unique count and from the global stats.

### Why ‚ÄúIn Use‚Äù can flip back to ‚ÄúAvailable‚Äù while you‚Äôre still on a phone
Mobile browsers often throttle or suspend background tabs and even foreground pages during inactivity or screen lock. When heartbeats pause for >30 seconds, the server will mark the connection stale and remove your visitor from counts until a new message arrives (e.g., upon reconnect or interaction).

Mitigations and options:
- Keep the device awake or screen on while actively using the app.
- Ensure the tab remains in the foreground; avoid OS power-saving modes that suspend networking.
- If your environment requires longer tolerance, you can increase the heartbeat timeout in code.
  - In `main.py`, ConnectionManager sets `self.heartbeat_timeout = 30` (seconds). Adjusting this value increases tolerance to backgrounding but delays stale cleanup.

### Troubleshooting live status
- Open the Logs page: navigate to `/logs` to view recent events.
- Check API logs under `src/logs/api/` and errors under `src/logs/errors/`.
- Look for entries like ‚ÄúWebSocket message received‚Äù, ‚Äúheartbeat‚Äù, ‚ÄúCleaning up stale connection‚Äù, or ‚ÄúUser X joined/left app‚Äù.
